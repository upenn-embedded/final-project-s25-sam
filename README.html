<h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
<h3>1. Abstract</h3>
<p>SlouchBuster is a device to help detect and correct poor posture.  It’s a cushion device that senses bad posture and alters the user depending on how much time has passed and what type of improper posture has been detected; specifically, it uses a buzzer after 3 minutes of bad posture, and an LCD display to alert &#x26; direct the user. The device tracks posture based on pressure sensors, an ultrasonic sensor, and an IMU, and it communicates via Wi-Fi to provide the user with a posture summary through a mobile app.</p>
<h3>2. Motivation</h3>
<p>In today’s digital age, where long hours are spent sitting at desks, on devices, and on couches, poor posture has become an increasingly prevalent issue. Many suffer from back and neck pain, headaches,  poor circulation, and other musculoskeletal problems due to improper sitting and slouching habits. However, poor posture often goes unnoticed and it can be hard to be aware of posture throughout the day. This can lead to chronic discomfort, decreased productivity, and long term health issues.</p>
<p>The purpose of our project is to create a posture detection device that helps users maintain proper sitting posture by providing real-time feedback and alerts when poor posture is detected. We also aim to make our device user friendly and to give users the opportunity to track their progress over time.</p>
<p>This project is interesting because  it integrates advanced embedded systems techniques to a real and widespread health problem. By using sensors, real-time feedback, and smart features, this posture detection device has the potential to improve users’ quality of lids by helping them be aware of their sitting habits (and hopefully training them to develop better sitting habits).</p>
<p>This project brings together techniques such as power management, noise filtering, and wireless communication, which makes it a challenging and impactful solution. It’s a chance to merge technology with everyday health in a practical way &#x26; can help improve daily life.</p>
<h3>3. System Block Diagram</h3>
<p><img src="./images/block.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>4. Design Sketches</h3>
<p><img src="./images/design.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We will have most of our sensors and electronics embedded in a chair pillow. This includes our IMU, pressure sensors, buzzer, and ultrasonic sensor. The Atmega and ESP32 will be stored in a box connected to the side of the cushion, and the LCD will be on the armrest of the chair.</p>
<h3>5. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</h3>
<p>The device must detect when the user is sitting in improper postures (such as slouching, tilting forward, or leaning) using a combination of IMU, pressure sensors, and ultrasonic sensors. The device must differentiate between good posture (e.g., sitting upright) and bad posture (e.g., slouching or leaning). The device must alert the user in real-time when bad posture is detected. The device must measure how long the user maintains poor posture. It should only trigger the buzzer after 2 minutes of poor posture and continue buzzing until the posture is corrected. After detecting poor posture for 2 minutes, the device should display clear corrective messages (e.g., "Sit Back," "Sit Straight," "Stop Leaning") on the LCD to guide the user toward better posture. The feedback should include auditory (buzzer) and visual (LCD display) cues to correct the posture. The device must store and log posture data (such as duration of poor posture and type of posture detected) for the user to track their improvements.</p>
<p>Validation Method: Simulate different postures (e.g., slouching, leaning forward, sitting upright) and verify that the IMU, pressure sensors, and ultrasonic sensors correctly detect each posture type.</p>
<p>Metric: Ensure that the device can accurately differentiate between good and bad posture, with no false positives (incorrectly detecting good posture as bad) and no false negatives (failing to detect bad posture).</p>
<p>Validation Method: Test the device by sitting in different postures for various durations and ensure that the buzzeractivates after 2 minutes of bad posture and continues until the posture is corrected. Also, test the LCD display to verify it shows the correct message after poor posture is detected.</p>
<p>Metric: The buzzer should sound within 5 seconds of poor posture detection and continue until the user adjusts their position. The LCD should display the appropriate corrective message within 5 seconds of the buzzer sounding.</p>
<p>Validation Method: Measure the time the device takes to detect bad posture and trigger the buzzer after 2 minutes. Ensure that once poor posture is corrected, the buzzer stops and the device logs the duration of the bad posture.</p>
<p>Metric: The buzzer should only be triggered after exactly 2 minutes of bad posture, and it should stop as soon as the user adjusts to correct posture.</p>
<p>Validation Method: Test that the LCD display shows the appropriate message after bad posture is detected for 2 minutes. For example, test sitting slouched and verify that the message reads "Sit Back" or "Sit Straight."</p>
<p>Metric: The correct posture correction message should be shown based on the type of poor posture detected.</p>
<p>Validation Method: Simulate a series of posture events (e.g., good posture for 5 minutes, bad posture for 2 minutes) and check that the device logs the duration of bad posture and stores this information in a local storage or sends it to a cloud database.</p>
<p>Metric: Ensure that the logged data is accurate and that it’s synced with a mobile app, showing progress over time. For example, if the user improves their posture over several sessions, the data should reflect a reduction in bad posture duration.</p>

<h3>6. Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS)</h3>
<p>The posture detection device must be capable of accurately detecting when a user is sitting with poor posture, such as slouching, leaning forward, or tilting to one side. It must use a combination of IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), pressure sensors, and ultrasonic sensors to track the user’s movements and seating position in real-time. The IMU will monitor the angle of the user's body, detecting any tilting or slouching. The pressure sensors will measure the distribution of weight on the cushion to identify improper posture, such as leaning to one side. The ultrasonic sensor will track the distance between the user's back and the cushion to detect forward slouching or tilting. Once poor posture is detected for a sustained period (e.g., 2 minutes), the device must provide real-time feedback via a buzzer and an LCD display to alert the user to adjust their posture. The buzzer will continue to sound until the user corrects their position. The LCD will display specific corrective messages based on the type of poor posture detected, such as "Sit Back" or "Sit Straight."</p>
<p>During validation testing, each sensor's performance will be carefully evaluated. The IMU will be tested by moving the device through different angles, ensuring it detects slouching or tilting accurately at the required sampling rate of 100Hz. The pressure sensors will be validated by applying known weights and ensuring that pressure changes are detected accurately at 200ms intervals. The ultrasonic sensor will be tested by measuring the distance at different positions, confirming the accuracy of the readings within a ±1 cm tolerance. The buzzer will be tested by simulating poor posture and ensuring that it activates after 2 minutes, and remains on until the posture is corrected. The LCD display will be validated by displaying corrective messages, ensuring they are clearly visible under normal lighting conditions. Finally, the device’s power consumption will be measured to ensure it operates efficiently, with less than 300mA during normal use and entering low-power mode after 5 minutes of inactivity. The ESP32's ability to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection will also be validated, ensuring seamless data synchronization with the mobile app within 5 seconds. These tests will verify that the system functions as intended and meets all design specifications.</p>

<h3>9. Sprint Planning</h3>
<p>Sprint milestone planning will happen on the Sunday prior to each week. Saanvi and Aagam will meet either in person or via video conference to write down what was accomplished in the previous week, and what remains to be done. Then, we will divide up the work and commit our plans to the git repository.</p>
<p>We will divide up the work first for each subsegment of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saanvi will work on getting the Buzzer, LCD and Force/Pressure Sensors working</li>
<li>Aagam will work on the ESP32-S2 feather, Ultrasonic sensor, and the code to handle interrupts working.</li>
